            <h1>Security Strategies for Your WordPress Website</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Security is the most unforgivable aspect of any website. While people might tolerate a slightly slower
                website or a somewhat complicated user experience, compromising their data due to negligence in
                addressing security is a significant blow to your brand reputation and business.</p>
            <p>This guide will help you understand the primary vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise
                your website. It outlines best practices to prevent such breaches and significantly reduce potential
                risks.</p>


            <h2>Strengthening WordPress Hosting Security</h2>

            <p>The foundation of your website lies in its hosting environment, and if the foundation is shaky, the top
                will crumble no matter what it is made of. Obviously, no system is infallible, and even popular top
                hosting providers <a

                    get hacked</a>, but you can still take proactive measures to tilt the odds in your favor.</p>
            <h3> Prevention Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose reputable WordPress hosting providers that prioritize robust security.</li>
                <li>Research whether the provider has experienced recent security breaches.</li>
                <li>Assess the hosting platformâ€™s security tools, such as firewalls, and their adherence to best
                    practices like regular software updates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ensuring Theme and Plugin Security</h2>
            <figure>
                <img decoding="async"
                    src="./assets/img/fly-d-mT7lXZPjk7U-unsplash.jpg.webp"
                    alt="Theme and Plugin Security">
            </figure>
            <p>The core of WordPress has thousands of developers contributing to it and it is well-made. Issues may
                arise when including 3rd party themes and plugins. Therefore, itâ€™s essential to exercise careful
                selection and control over the ones you choose to incorporate. </p>
            <h3>Prevention Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize themes and plugins from trusted sources with established security credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Never download cracked versions of paid plugins/themes</strong>, as this could expose your
                    website to vulnerabilities. A recent experience involved cleaning a hacked clientâ€™s site resulting
                    from such downloads.</li>
                <li>Regularly update themes, plugins, and the WordPress core to access the latest security enhancements.
                </li>
                <li>Minimize risks by removing any unused or unnecessary themes and plugins from your website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Poor WordPress Development Practices</h2>
            <figure>
                <img decoding="async"
                    src="./assets/img/luca-bravo-XJXWbfSo2f0-unsplash.jpg.webp"
                    alt="Wordpress Development">
            </figure>
            <p>Not long ago (just a year back), I held the naive belief that a developer could bypass the need for
                security training. However, my perspective rapidly shifted after completing a CyberSecurity course.
                Witnessing the multiple methods by which websites can be targeted, I recognized the necessity of this
                skill. While a developer need not attain expert-level security knowledge, possessing an awareness of
                common vulnerabilities and insights into a hackerâ€™s mindset is pivotal when building any website.</p>
            <h3>Prevention Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate with WordPress developers who follow security standards.</li>
                <li>You might want/need to build your website yourself. If it is a simple website like a blog or landing
                    page, itâ€™s okay, if it is a website with sensitive information like an e-commerce website, hire
                    someone. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Guarding Against Insider Threats</h2>
            <figure>
                <img loading="lazy" decoding="async"
                    src="./assets/img/kevin-ku-w7ZyuGYNpRQ-unsplash.jpg.webp"
                    alt="Insider Threat WordPress Security">
            </figure>
            <p>Internal users, whether inadvertently or intentionally, can threaten your websiteâ€™s security. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Twitter_account_hijacking">Consider the 2020 Twitter
                    account hijacking as an example</a>. In this instance, attackers didnâ€™t exploit vulnerable code but
                targeted vulnerable employees. Numerous such instances serve as a reminder of the potential risk.</p>
            <h3>Prevention Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enforce strict user access controls to limit privileges based on roles.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular security training for staff, emphasizing solid passwords and security awareness.
                </li>
                <li>Utilize monitoring tools to detect and prevent unauthorized user actions.</li>
                <li>Be careful whom you hire.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Securing your WordPress website involves a multi-faceted approach to address vulnerabilities across
                different areas. By taking proactive steps to secure hosting, user access, plugins, and themes, you can
                fortify your website against potential threats. Vigilance and continuous efforts are vital to
                maintaining a secure and trustworthy online presence.</p>
